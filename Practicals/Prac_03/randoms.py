# What did you see on line 1?
# What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest?
# I saw it print a random number between five and twenty.
# The smallest number I could of seen is five and the largest is twenty.

# What did you see on line 2?
# What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest?
# Could line 2 have produced a 4?
# I saw a number between three and 10 being printed, skipping a number each time.
#
# Line two could not have produced a four because it started at three and skipped a number each time.

# What did you see on line 3?
# What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest?
# I saw line three print a floating point number between 2.5 and 5.5.
# The smallest number I could of seen was 2.5 and the largest was 5.5.
